# Odin Recipes

## A barebones html-only example recipes website

This project is a brutalist fake recipes website using nothing but html as part of The Odin Project.

The skills learned from the exercise were as following:
 * html boilerplate
 * embedding images
 * linking to other html pages
 * ordered and unordered lists
 * use of header elements
